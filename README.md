This code was used to playtest Equestria Dominion, a fan expansion of Dominion based off the show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.
My first ever Java project that was meaningfully large, so there's probably some absolutely horrible code in here. Sorry about that.
If you are unfamiliar with Dominion, Google is your friend.
Only supports solitaire play, and doesn't tell you want the cards do. It's functional, but it definitely isn't pretty.

I do not own the rights to Dominion in any way, shape, or form.
